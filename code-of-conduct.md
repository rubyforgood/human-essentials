# Code of conduct

**All people who choose to be a part of our community are required to agree with the following code of conduct.**

We expect everyone to help create a safe, positive, and welcoming environment for everyone.

Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, 
gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, 
religion (or lack thereof), or any other intrinsic characteristic that makes us who we are.

Harassment is the expression of ideas, through actions or words, intended or known to shame, intimidate, 
or harm another person. Harassment hurts people, and by extension destroys communities.

Harassment may include, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments related to any of those intrinsic 
characteristics by which we define our humanity, the display of sexually explicit images, deliberate physical 
intimidation, stalking,  photography or recording without consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, 
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
