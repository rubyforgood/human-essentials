# Support

There are a few ways to get support -- some are better than others.
## For Banks:
### Slack 
We highly recommend that you become a member of the Human Essentials Slack.  Here's a link to an invite:  https://human-essential.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-bfa8tymd-d8Ks3Mq000COcRe~nfs~zg#/shared-invite/email

It's a good place to ask about how other banks *actually* use the system 
    -- any workarounds for things that don't 100% match how the system is set up.
       (for instance, 1 bank has added an item that they use for the partners to report how many children are served by a bulk request.)

It's often the quickest way to get support from the human essentials team as well, and the easiest way to interact with the development team.
### Support tickets
There is a link to submit a support ticket is at the bottom of the "Need Help?"  screen.   This will get to us, 
    but it will take longer.  We generally look at these about once a week, on Sundays.
### Email

You can email info@humanessentials.app.   We generally look at these about once a week, on Sundays.

### Stakeholder circle
We hold a stakeholder circle the first Wednesday of every month at 6:00pm Eastern Time.  There will be other banks there, plus a couple members of the Human Essentials team.
We publish the zoom, and (when we remember) in the Announcements in Human Essentials.


### Keeping up-to-date with changes
We release changes to the system most weeks on Sundays between 10am and noon Eastern time (the system will be down for a short period when we do).   When we do, we put up an announcment in the system, which you will see on your [dashboard](essentials_dashboard.md).   We also record them in a newsletter at: https://ruby-for-good.gitbook.io/human-essentials-news 




## For partners:
We recommend that the partners seek support through the banks.  Each bank has their own particular way of doing things, and the development team doesn't want to mess that up.
