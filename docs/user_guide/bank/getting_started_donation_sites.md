# Donation Sites
[TODO:  If we have reworked the getting started to exclude donation sites,  move this all to the community section]

A donation site represents a drop-off location for donations.
The information regarding a donation site is mainly for your reference.  There are, at time of writing, no automated emails that go to the donation sites' contacts.
Note that you can filter your donation list ( see [Donations](essentials_donations.md)) by donation site.

## The donation site list
To see a list of your donation sites, click on "Community", then "Donation Sites" in the left-hand menu.
[TODO: Navigation screenshot]
The donation site list lists all your active donation sites.  This list includes:
- Donation Site name
- Address
- Contact Name
- E-mail
- Phone
## Adding a donation site
[TODO:  If we haven't reworked the getting started to exclude donation sites, include it here]

From the donation site list (above), then click on "New Donation Site" 

[TODO:  Why do we have two ways to create a donation site (probably 3, I expect there is a short cut in donations).  Put a request in the inbox to simplify this.  I'm making an 'executive decision' that we should keep the "new donation site" way for consistency]

Then fill in the information and click "Save".

(note: at time of writing, you can also create a donation site using the fields at the top of the donation sites screen, but we will be removing that as extraneous.)

## Viewing a donation site
From the donation site list (above),  click on the "view" button beside the desired donation site.  

[TODO:  The header in this needs help -- inbox!]

[TODO:  Screenshot]

As well as the basic information for the donation site,  the donation site view lists every donation that is associated with that donation site, including:
- Storage location
- Quantity of items
- Variety of items (i.e. how many different items were donated)
- and a link to the donation

## Editing a donation site
From the donation site list (above), you can change the basic information for a donation site by clicking "Edit" beside that donation site.

[TODO: Navigational screenshot]

[TODO: Edit screenshot]
Make the changes to the displayed information (Name, Address, Contact Name, Email, and Phone), and click "Save".

## Deactivating a donation site
When a donation site is no longer in service, you can deactivate it from the donation site list by clicking "Deactivate" beside it, and confirming your choice.

##### (NB) at time of writing there is no way for you to undo this.
