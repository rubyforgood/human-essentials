# Manufacturers Donations Report

To access this report,  click 'Reports", then "Donations - Manufacturers"

![manufacturer_donations_report_default](images/reports/reports_manufacturer_donations_1.png)


This shows the number of items donated by manufacturers over the indicated time period (default current year), as well as the top manufacturers donating in that time period.
[TODO:  Confirm -- is this true -- or is this still broken?]

From here, you can click on the listed manufacturers to see a breakdown of their donations.

Or enter a new donation (by clicking on "New Donation", naturally.)

Or see all donations for the time period, by clicking on 'See more...'

If you want to see a time period other than the current year,  change the date range and click "Filter".  We recommend you use the little pop-up gizmo to enter your date range, as the format of the date range is very fussy.
