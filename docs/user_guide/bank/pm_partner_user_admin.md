# Administering partner users

Partners can add users themselves,  but occasionally a bank may need to step in and administer partner users (for instance, if the only person who uses the system leaves the partner.)

## Where do you administer partner users?

If you need to administer a partner's users,  click on "Partner Agencies" in the left-hand menu,  then "All Partners",
then click on the specific partner you want to administer,  and then "Manage Users" near the top of that screen.

This will bring you to a list of users for that partner.   Here you can resend invitations (A), start a reset password process (B) (they will receive an email with a link to reset their password), Remove access to that partner from the user(C),  or invite a new user to that partner (D).
