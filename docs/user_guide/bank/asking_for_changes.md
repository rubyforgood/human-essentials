# Asking for changes

Although we are a small team with a long list of tweaks and improvements that we are working toward,  we do welcome ideas for how Human Essentials can support your work better.  

The best ways to get those to us are through the Slack channel or by coming to the Stakeholder Circle and raising them there.

The Stakeholder Circle has the advantage of being able to talk live to other banks *and* the development team in the same space.   We've had a lot of "Oh, we didn't realize that" moments in these meetings that directly result in changes to the system.

(The Slack channel, on the other hand, is open every day.)
