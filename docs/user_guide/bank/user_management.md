DRAFT USER GUIDE
# User Management

The bank organization admin users can manage both the staff who have access to humanessentials at the bank, and at each of the bank's partners.
The partners can manage their own users as well, but it is sometimes necessary for the bank to be able to add a user at the partner agency due to staff turnover.

### How do I know what access I have?
If you look at the left-hand menu, and you see, down at the bottom, a section "My Organization", then you have admin access.
Otherwise,  if you see "Donations", you have bank user access.
If, instead, you see "My Profile", you are signed in as a partner.
