# Adding a single partner
To add a single partner,  you can either Click on the "Add a Partner" button in the "Getting Started" section of your dashboard (if you are, indeed, just getting started), or click "Partner Agencies" in the left-hand menu, then "All Partners", then "New Partner Agency".

This just sets up the partner in your bank so you can distribute to them.   If you want them to be able to make requests, you'll need to [invite](pm_inviting_a_partner.md) them.
