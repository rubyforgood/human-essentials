# Levels of Access

There are 4 different levels of access in the system:
1. Organization Admin
2. Organization User
3. Partner
4. Super Admin

(We are currently discussing adding a User who is restricted to a specific location, but we don't have it yet)

## Organization Admin

Organization Admins are the top-level User at your essentials bank.  They can do everything an Organization User (see below) can do, plus: 

- Administer the Users for your bank ( see [User Management](getting_started_user_management.md))
- Administer the Users for your partners ( see [Partner User Management](pm_partner_user_admin.md))
- Finalize Audits (see [Audits](inventory_audits.md))
- Customize organization settings( see [Customization](getting_started_customization.md))

## Organization User
This is your basic user for your bank -- they can do all the data entry except for those things reserved for the Organization Admin, above.  Organization Users have the right to:

- Enter Donations, Purchases, Distributions
- Fulfil Requests
- View Pickup and Delivery calendars
- Administer Partners (excluding partner user management)
- Perform Audit data entry (finalization is reserved for the Organization Admin)
- Manage the community information (Donation Sites, Product Drives, Product Drive Participants, Manufacturers)
- View all the bank-level reports

## Partner
A Partner User's access is, of course, limited to the scope of the Partner they belong to.
Within that scope, they can:
- Edit their Partner profile
- Submit Requests (if the Partner has been approved)
- View their Distributions
- Administer Families and Children (only if they are allowed to make Child Requests (this can be limited by the Org Admin,  see [Customization](getting_started_customization.md) )) (note,  the other user types cannot see this information)

## Super Admin
This bit is for information only -- A limited number of Human Essentials staff have a superadmin role that allows us to perform the following duties:
- Review and approve Account requests
- Make system-wide announcements
- Administer users (we need it because every once in awhile, the organization admin for a bank will leave without promoting someone else to that role.)
- Administer Base Items
- Administer the list of NDBN members
- Administer some organization settings
