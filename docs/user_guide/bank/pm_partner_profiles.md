READY FOR REVIEW

# Partner Profiles
Partner Profiles allow you to gather and hold a lot of information about your Partners that may be useful for meeting your regulatory requirements, managing their experience, and for grant-writing.  

There is a *lot* of information in the profiles, and the information that is needed varies from bank to bank.  Once you decide what information you need from your partners, you can set up the Partner Profiles to show the sections that you need, customizing it through ["My organization"](getting_started_customization.md).

## How does a Partner fill in and submit their profile

In the Partner's view of the system,  they can click on "Edit My Profile" to fill in all the information you want.  
Once they have saved this,  they will also see a "Submit for Approval" button.   Clicking that changes their status to "Waiting for Approval", and makes them appear in your [dashboard](essentials_dashboard.md)  list of partners waiting for approval, as well as making a "Review Partner's application" button appear beside them in your view of all the Partners.

# Viewing a Partner Profile
The Partner's profile is viewable by clicking Partner Agencies in the left hand menu, then All Partners, then the name of the Partner. Scroll down to "Partner Profile"
![Partner Profile View Navigation 1](images/partners/partners_profile_view_navigation_1.png)
![Partner Profile View Navigation 2](images/partners/partners_profile_view_navigation_2.png)



More information about the partner profile can be found under "Editing a Partner's Profile", below.
# Editing a Partner's Profile

![Partner Profile Edit Navigation 1](images/partners/partners_profile_edit_navigation_1.png)
![Partner Profile Edit Navigation 2](images/partners/partners_profile_edit_navigation_2.png)

This will bring you to the partner profile edit screen
It is initially presented with all the sections collapsed.  Clicking on any of them will open the appropriate section.

You can save your progress by pressing the "Save Progress" button -- that will save what you have done, but keep this screen up.
Clicking "Save and Review" will save what you've entered, and go to the profile view.
In either case,  the whole profile will be checked for errors, which you will have to resolve to save.

This asks what county/county equivalents the agency serves and what proportion of their client share is in which area.

At this time, this only covers U.S. counties and equivalents.   We believe the list covers *all* of the U.S, including some areas that are not tecnically counties.    
Let us know if you need more!

The sum of the client share has to be either 0 or 100, and the numbers have to be positive whole numbers.

You start out with space for 1 county, but can add more with the "Add Another County button"

#### Race/Ethnicity of Client Base
This subsection is comprised of questions about the race/ethnicity of the client base and the poverty level of the Partner's client base.

Only the options that you haven't already turned off will show up there,  and at least one has to be checked.
