READY FOR REVIEW

# Partner Profiles

[!NOTE]  We are in progress of reworking the Partner Profiles.  In the interest of not duplicating effort,  we have not included the screenshots in this section until that is ready for launch.

Partner Profiles allow you to gather and hold a lot of information about your Partners that may be useful for meeting your regulatory requirements, managing their experience, and for grant-writing.  

There is a *lot* of information in the profiles, and the information that is needed varies from bank to bank.  Once you decide what information you need from your partners, you can set up the Partner Profiles to show the sections that you need, customizing it through ["My organization"](getting_started_customization.md).

## How does a Partner fill in and submit their profile

In the Partner's view of the system,  they can click on "Edit My Profile" to fill in all the information you want.  
Once they have saved this,  they will also see a "Submit for Approval" button.   Clicking that changes their status to "Waiting for Approval", and makes them appear in your [dashboard](essentials_dashboard.md)  list of partners waiting for approval, as well as making a "Review Partner's application" button appear beside them in your view of all the Partners.

# Viewing a Partner Profile
The Partner's profile is viewable by clicking Partner Agencies in the left hand menu, then All Partners, then "view" beside the Partner in question. Scroll down to "Partner Profile"
# Editing a Partner's Profile
You can edit a Partner Profile clicking Partner Agencies in the left hand menu, then All Partners, then "view" beside the partner in question. Scroll down to "Partner Profile", then click "Edit Information."

This provides a place for the agency to indicate their major communication outlets. 

*If* the bank chooses to ask for this information,  the Partner must fill in at least one of the fields:

- Website
- Facebook
- Twitter   (yes, we know it's called X now)

None of these fields are mandatory.

### Area Served (County/Client Share %)
This asks what county/county equivalents the agency serves and what proportion of their client share is in which area.

At this time, this only covers U.S. counties and equivalents.   We believe the list covers *all* of the U.S, including some areas that are not tecnically counties.    
Let us know if you need more!

The sum of the client share has to be either 0 or 100, and the numbers have to be positive whole numbers.

You start out with space for 1 county, but can add more with the "Add Another County button"

### Population Served
This section has only two questions: 
- Clients Have An Income Requirement to Work With You?
- Do You Verify The Income Of Your Clients?
- 
### Race/Ethnicity of Client Base
This section is comprised of questions about the race/ethnicity of the client base and the poverty level of the Partner's client base.
There is no check on whether the numbers add up to 100 -- because there may be overlap.

### Race/Ethnicity: 
- % African American; % Caucasian; % Hispanic; % Asian; % American Indian; % Pacific Island; % Multi-racial; % Other
- Zip Codes Served

### Poverty Information of those Served:
- % at FPL or Below   (FPL is Federal Poverty Line)
- % above 1-2 times FPL
- % Greater than 2 times FPL
- % Poverty Unknown

### Executive Director

This is for your information only.  It is not used for any emails.

  - This is meant to be the documentation required for new clients

### Additional Documents
This is a place to upload additional documents that you need from your Partner.

### Settings (not configurable)
Many banks restrict the Partners to one kind of request (see [Customization](getting_started_customization.md)).  If you don't, the Partner can still simplify their request experience by unclicking the items that don't apply.
Only the options that you haven't already turned off will show up there,  and at least one has to be checked.
- Enable Quantity-based Requests
- Enable Child-based Requests
- Enable Requests for Individuals
