# Partner Profiles

Partner profiles allow you to gather and hold a lot of information about your partners that may be useful for meeting your regulatory requirements, managing their experience, and for grant-writing.  

There is a *lot* of information in the profile, and the information that is needed varies from bank to bank.  Once you decide what information you need from your partners, you can set up the partner profiles to show the sections that you need, customizing it through ["My organization"](getting_started_customization.md).

## How does a partner fill in and submit their profile

In the partner's view of the system,  they can click on "Edit My Profile" to fill in all the information you want.  
Once they have save this,  they will also see a "Submit for Approval" button.   Clicking that changes their status to "Waiting for Approval", and makes them appear in your [dashboard](essentials_dashboard.md)  list of partners waiting for approval, as well as making a "Review partner's application" button appear beside them in your view of all the partners.

# Viewing a partner's profile

# Editing a partner's profile

### Area Served (County/Client Share %)
This asks what county/county equivalents the agency serves and what proportion of their client share is in which area.

At this time, this only covers U.S. counties.   We believe the list covers *all* of the U.S, including some areas that are not counties.    
Let us know if you need more!

The sum of the client share has to be either 0 or 100, and the numbers have to be positive whole numbers.

You start out with 1 county, but can add more with the "Add Another County button"

This section has only two questions:

- 
### Race/Ethnicity of Client Base
This section is comprised of questions about the race/ethnicity of the client base and the poverty level of the client base.
There is no check on whether the numbers add up to 100 -- because there may be overlap.

### Pick Up Person
The Pick Up person will receive an email when the distribution is scheduled.

[TODO: Check -- is it only on pickups, or do they get it for deliveries too?]

### Additional Documents
This is a place to upload additional documents that you need from your partner.

### Settings (not configurable)
Many banks restrict the partners to one kind of request (see [Customization](getting_started_customization.md)).  If you don't, the partner can still simplify their request experience by unclicking the items that don't apply.
Only the options that you haven't already turned off will show up here,  and at least one has to be checked.
- Enable Quantity-based Requests
- Enable Child-based Requests
- Enable Requests for Individuals
