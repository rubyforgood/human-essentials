# Summary Reports

There are 3 Summary reports - one each for Distributions, Donations, and Purchases

These each allow you to quickly get the number of Items dealt with in a timeframe, plus links to recent activity

## Distribution Summary
This gives the number of Items distributed -- initially for the last 60 days (and 30 days forward), but you can filter by whatever date range you wish.  This filtering works against the "issued_at" date on the Distribution, rather than the date it was entered. 

The report also gives the number of Items that are in Distributions that have an "issued at" in the future.

The "Recent Distributions" section shows recently entered Distributions that match the date filter.   That is,  whether or not a Distribution shows here is based on the filter,  but the order depends on when it was entered -- latest first.

## Donation Summary
This is quite similar to the Distribution summary, above.

This gives the number of Items donated -- initially for the last 60 days, but you can filter by whatever date range you wish.  This filtering works against the "issued on" date on the Donation, rather than the date it was entered.
It also gives the total of monetary donations recorded in the system for that period
The "Recent Donations" section shows recently entered Donations that match the date filter.   That is,  whether or not a donation shows here is based on the filter,  but the order depends on when it was entered -- latest first.

## Purchase Summary
This presents the amounts spent during the period, along with recently entered Purchases that match the date filter.  The filter works on the issued on date, but the ordering is by the creation date of the Purchase, newest first.
