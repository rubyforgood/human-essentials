READY FOR REVIEW
# Coming Soon -- Custom Units (opt-in feature)

The number of items throughout the bank's view of the system is the number of units (e.g. diapers), but
Partners often think in terms of packs of diapers.   Because Banks were getting a lot of partners requesting the number of packs of diapers, instead of the number of diapers, we are introducing the ability for banks to allow the partners to request other units (e.g. packs)

In short, you'll be able to add custom units that they partners can request.   The partners then can ask for, say, 'packs' of diapers.   You will still have to translate those to the number of items when distributing, because there is a lot of variety in pack size across brands.


When this is ready for release, we will update this page, but to preview:
[!NOTE] None of the following steps are available yet.
- A bank that wishes to use custom units will add those units on their organization page 
- Then, for any Items that will use the custom units (you are not going to have the same units for car seats and diapers), you add them to that Item
- At that point, the Partners will see a slightly different screen that will have them pick between "units" and the custom units (say, "packs")
- When the bank sees the request,  they will see the units that were chosen,  but have to enter the total quantity for that item (in our example, the number of diapers)
- The units the partner chose will show wherever we are showing the requested amounts (e.g. when viewing the request,  when calculating Product Totals, when fulfilling the request, and in the pdf that is attached to their Distribution email.
