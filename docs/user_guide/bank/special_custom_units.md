# Custom Units

The number of items throughout the bank's view of the system is the number of units (e.g. diapers), but
Partners often think in terms of packs of diapers.   Because Banks were getting a lot of partners requesting the number of packs of diapers, instead of the number of diapers, we have introduced the ability for banks to allow the partners to request other units (e.g. packs)

This deserves a page of it's own - but in short,  you can specify units here, that you can add to your items.   The partners then can ask for, say, 'packs' of diapers.   You will still have to translate those to the number of items when distributing
Because there is a lot of variety in pack size across brands.
