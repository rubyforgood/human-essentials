# Product Drives
Many banks hold seasonal or one-off events where they are seeking donations.  In Human Essentials, Product drives help manage those events by providing a way to link specific donations to the events.

[TODO:  For consistency, I would remove 'New Product Drive' from the lhs, and change "All Product Drives" to "Product Drives]

## Product drives list
To see all your product drives, click on "Community", then "All Product Drives" in the left-hand menu.

This presents a filterable list of all your product drives, including the following fields:
- Product Drive Name
- Start Date
- End Date (this is optional)
- Held Virtually?
- Quantity of Items
- Variety of Items
- In-Kind Value (TODO:  Fix spelling in header)
- Actions (only view at the moment)

The list initially shows all the product drives starting in the current year.

[TODO:  Is that right,  or is it all product drives that are at least partly in the current year?   It probably should be the latter]

### Filtering you product drives list
The product drives list is filterable by any of the following. 
- Product drive name
- Item category
- Date range (by starting date)

[TODO:  confirm how the date range works.]

Provide the information you want to filter by, then click "Filter".  Clicking "Clear Filters"  will return the list to its defaults.

## Adding a product drive
To add a product drive, either:
a) click "Community", then "New Product Drive" in the left hand menu, or
b) click "+New Product Drive" in the Product Drives list
[TODO:  Navigation screenshot]

Either will bring up this screen, which contains all the fields you can specify for a new product drive:
- Name
- Start Date
- End Date (this is optional)
