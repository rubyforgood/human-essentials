# Approving Partners

There are three paths in to reviewing a Partner's information before approving them to make requests -- 

1/  There is a list of partners awaiting approvals on the dashboard.   To start the approval process, click "Review Application";

or

2/  Click "Partner Agencies" and "All Partners" in the left-hand menu, then "Review Application" beside the partner.

----------------------------------

In any of these cases, you can view all the answers in the profile.  If something needs changing, you can do it yourself by clicking the "Edit Information" button,  or the partner can make the change.   

See [Partner profiles](partner_profiles.md) for details on the partner profile.

[TODO:  Link should go to the part of partner profiles that lists all the fields]

Once you have reviewed the partner's info, and want to approve them to make requests,  click the "Approve Partner " button.   

[TODO: Screenshot]

You should see a "Partner Approved!" message,  and the status of the partner will show as "Approved"
