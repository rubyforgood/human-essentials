or

3/  Click "Partner Agencies" and "All Partners" in the left-hand menu, then click the Partner's name.  Scroll down to view the Partner Profile information, and click "Approve Partner" if it has what is needed.


----------------------------------

In any of these cases, you can view all the answers in the profile.  If something needs changing, you can do it yourself by clicking the "Edit Information" button,  or the Partner can make the change.   

See [Partner profiles](pm_partner_profiles.md#viewing-a-partner-profile) for details on the Partner Profile.

Once you have reviewed the Partner's info, and want to approve them to make requests,  click the "Approve Partner " button.
