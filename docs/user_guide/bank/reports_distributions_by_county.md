# Distributions by County Report


![distributions_by_county_default_view](images/reports/reports_distributions_by_county_1.png)

This report shows the total items and estimated total market value of the distributed items for the time period.

We use the area served information entered in each partner's [profile](pm_partner_profiles.md) to allocate the items that have been distributed to them.  If that information has not been provided,  the items you've distributed are put into the 'Unspecified' category.

  
**N.B.** If you are using kits, please note that this treats each kit as an item,  rather than counting the items within the kits separately.

If you want to see a time period other than the default of 60 days prior to 30 days forward from today,  change the date range and click "Filter".  We recommend you use the little pop-up gizmo to enter your date range, as the format of the date range is very fussy.
