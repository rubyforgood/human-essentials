READY FOR REVIEW

There are a few other things with Partners that didn't fit into any of the sections above:

1/  You can see the Families served, Children served and zipcodes served, when you view a partner
- Families served -- if the partner is using Child Requests, this is a count of the Families they have entered.
- Children served -- if the partner is using Child requests,  this is a count of active Children (confirm),
- Zipcodes - these are directly from the zipcodes entered in the Partner Profile
2/  You can see the prior Distributions for this partner, at the bottom of the view of the Partner.
