DRAFT USER GUIDE

There are a few other things with partners that didn't fit into any of the sections above:

1/  You can see the families served, children served and zipcodes served
How do we get these numbers?  
[TODO:  confirm how we determine families, children, zipcode in this case]
- Families served -- if the partner is using child requests, this is a count of the families they have entered.
- Children served -- if the partner is using child requests,  this is a count of active children (confirm),
- Zipcodes - these are directly from the zipcodes entered in the partner profiles
- [TODO:  Should we also show counties served?]
2/  You can see the prior distributions for this partner, at the bottom of the view of the partner.
