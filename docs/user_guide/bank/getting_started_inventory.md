# Getting started -- Inventory
When we set up your organization, we provide a default set of Items ranging from adult briefs to kids (newborn) 
to tampons. You can modify this list at any time, through the [Inventory Items](inventory_items.md) feature.  

## Audits

Once you have determined your set of Items, the best way to set up your inventory is by performing an initial audit.  
This is a two-stage process where
1. users without admin access can enter the count for each item in a storage location and confirm the work, and then
2. a person with admin access finalizes the audit to set the inventory to the audited levels.

Please refer to the full information on audits, [here](inventory_audits.md).
