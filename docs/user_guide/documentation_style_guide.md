# Style Guide
This style guide is for Human Essentials user guides.  

Its purpose is to set the standard ways of dealing with matters of style, such as hyphenation, capitalization, etc.

We want to do a final pass to make everything consistent with the style guide before officially launching the guide.

## Spelling
Use U.S. spelling.  (The vast majority of our users are American)

## Capitalization
### Headings
In documentation, use title case for the main header for each page,  then use sentence case (see this page as an example).
### When quoting the system 
Match the text to what is in the application.  For instance, if a button says "Manage Product drives".  That being said,  if there is something in the app that is inconsistent,  let's get that fixed.

### Otherwise, always capitalize
Essentially, if you are referring to an object that has a view in Human Essentials,  capitalize it, including:
- Bank
- Partner
- Account
- Donation
- Purchase
- Product Drive
- Product Drive Participant
- Vendor
- Purchase
- Request
- Inventory
- Audit
- User

Also :
- Human Essentials
- Essentials Bank

## Hyphenation
- left-hand menu
- in-kind value
- email, not e-mail

## Specific words and phrases
- Ruby for Good



## If we have a question that is not covered here
For general style questions that are not covered here, refer to the Chicago Manual of Style.
