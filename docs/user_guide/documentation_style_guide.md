# Style Guide
This style guide is for the Human Essentials Bank user guide.  

Its purpose is to set the standard ways of dealing with matters of style, such as hypenation, capitalization, and the like.

We want to do a final pass to make everything consistent with the style guide before officially launching the guide.


## Capitalization
### Headings
In documentaion, use title case for the main header for each page,  then use sentence case (see this page as an example).
### When quoting the system 
Match the text to what is in the application.  For instance, if a button says "Manage Product drives".  That being said,  if there is something in the app that is inconsistent,  let's get that fixed.
### Otherwise, always capitalize
Essentially, if you are referring to an object that has a view in Human Essentials,  capitalize it
- Bank
- Partner
- Account
- Donation
- Purchase
- Product Drive
- Product Drive Participant
- Vendor
- Purchase
- Request
- Inventory
- Audit
