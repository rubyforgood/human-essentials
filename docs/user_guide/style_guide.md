# Style Guide
This style guide is for the Human Essentials Bank user guide.  

Its purpose is to set the standard ways of dealing with matters of style, such as hypenation, capitalization, and the like.

We want to do a final pass to make everything consistent with the style guide before officially launching the guide.


## Capitalization
### Headings
The first letter of a heading is capitalized.  After that,use lower case except for nouns that are always capitalized (see below)
### Objects in the app
Match the text to what is in the application.  For instance, if a button says "Manage Product drives".  That being said,  if there is something in the app that is inconsistent,  let's get that fixed.
### Always capitalize
Essentially, if it has a view in Human Essentials,  capitalize it
