# Levels of Access

There are 4 different levels of access in the system:
1. Organization Admin
2. Organization User
3. Partner
4. Super Admin

(We are currently discussing adding a user who is restricted to a specific location, but we don't have it yet)

## Organization Admin

Organization Admins are the top-level user at your essentials bank.  They can do everything an Organization User (see below) can do, plus: 

- Administer the users for your bank ( see [User Management](getting_started_user_management.md))
- Administer the users for your partners ( see [Partner User Management](pm_partner_user_admin.md))
- Finalize audits (see [Audits](inventory_audits.md))
- Customize organization settings( see [Customization](getting_started_customization.md))

## Organization User
This is your basic user for your bank -- they can do all the data entry except for those things reserved for the Organization Admin, above.  Organization Users have the right to:

- Enter donations, purchases, distributions
- Fulfil requests
- View pickup and delivery calendars
- Administer Partners (excluding partner user management)
- Perform Audit data entry (finalization is reserved for the Organization Admin)
- Manage the Community information
- View all the bank-level reports

## Partner
Partner users' access is, of course, limited to the scope of the Partner they belong to.
Within that scope, they can:
- Edit their partner profile
- Submit requests (if the Partner has been approved)
- View their distributions
- Administer families and children (only if they are allowed to make Child Requests (this can be limited by the Org Admin,  see [Customization](getting_started_customization.md) )) (note,  the other user types cannot see this information)

## Super Admin
This bit is for information only -- A limited number of Human Essentials staff have a superadmin role that allows us to perform the following duties:
- Review and approve Account requests
- Make system-wide announcements
- Administer users (we need it because every once in awhile, the organization admin for a bank will leave without promoting someone else to that role.)
- Administer "Base Items"
- Administer the list of NDBN members
- Administer some organization settings [TODO:  Raise the question of whether we *should* be administering most of this -- we don't have rights to change any of the more recently added values on the org.]
