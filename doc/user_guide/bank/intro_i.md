# Is Human Essentials right for you? (what we help with and what we don't)
## Human Essentials is a free system for essentials banks 
Human Essentials is for essentials banks -- by which we mean organizations that distribute essentials (diapers, period products, etc) to other organizations that work directly with people in need.

If you *only* deal directly with people in need,  this is probably not the system for you.

## We are an all-volunteer organization 

We can offer this system for free because we are an all-volunteer organization.   We have
sponsors who provide funding or in-kind services for the servers that the system runs on, but changes/support can take time.  

## What we help with
- managing your partners
  - gathering the information about your partners that you need
  - your request / distribution cycle (partner agencies can provide requests to you through the system, and you fulfill  them)
  - monthly reminders to the partners re request deadlines
  - calendar that shows when you've scheduled pickups and deliveries
- inventory
  - when you record donations, purchases, and distributions, your inventory record is automatically adjusted as of the date/time you enter the information
  - audits and inventory adjustments
  - handles multiple storage locations
  - making up kits for distribution from existing inventory (this is mostly used by our period supply focused banks)
- community management
  - keeping track of your donation sites, product drives (and participants)
- reporting
  - yearly report with much of the information the NDBN annual survey requires drawn from your activity in the system
  - itemized distribution breakdown over time
  - trend reporting
## Things we don't help with
- general business needs (like payroll and office supplies and the like)
- volunteer coordination
- donor tax receipts 
- direct distribution -- there are some things that help with that in the partner side, and some banks run a partner for their direct distribution, but it is not our strength.
