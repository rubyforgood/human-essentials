**How the Repo is Set up**

- Issues - where we have discussions on topics. They will also eventually be used to track bugs and feature requests. 
- Projects - Where we track progress on specific tasks that have multiple components. Can create Kanban boards.
- Wiki - For now, a catch-all on important information that pertains to both working groups e.g. list of resources
- Code - This is where the text and code will live. For now, the only thing contained are Read Me files and a folder for meeting agendas.
- You can make any changes you see fit. If you move the location of information the entire working group(s) need, open an issue, send an email or send a message on Slack to let everyone know.
