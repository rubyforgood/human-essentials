**Current Items**

- **DIAPER**: Get the total number of children/individuals served - [issue created](https://github.com/rubyforgood/diaper/issues/2073).
- **DIAPER**: Have the ability to get information on how many individuals a partner served, or fill it out before being able to do another order? 
- **DIAPER**: Monthly Quota; we need language to explain what a quota is and what it's referring to so it's easier for users to understand - should be renamed `request limit` - on the diaper side it is called `request limit`under `Requests`, but when you edit/set-up a new partner agency, the field is called `quota` - is it the same thing? What does it mean? 
- **DIAPER**: Created discussion on `tiers`, initiated conversation with core team.
- **PARTNER**: Impact stories from partners - verfiy if the code exists and is ready for release?
