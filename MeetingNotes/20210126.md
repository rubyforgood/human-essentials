**Current Items**



**Meeting Notes**

- Partner Group Feature Feedback: 
- - Rachel: suggested that we have a checkbox for items, instead of picking one at a time from a dropdown menu.
- - Kelly: asked if we could build out functionality for the different partner groups, so that users are able to customize the reminder email dates, for partners to get a notification at different times for ordering and pick-ups, to avoid scheduling bottle-necks (since Ozarks serves 100 partner agencies). 
- - Laurel: supported this request and said that this feature would enable them to combine their two accounts (for diaper supplies and period supplies) into one account.
- Sue and Kelly: specify how many kids each partner agency serves (reporting functionality).
- Sue: distributions, click on view, it totals up dollars spent, but not the diaper quantity 
- Jessica: as a potential user, she wants to wait on the timeline on when the reporting functionality will be built out before moving forward and would like to have a meeting with the core team. 
- Judi: can the email that is sent out to the partners be edited? 
- Lee Ann Porter: show history for entries of when the kits were added to the database
- Natalie: can the inventory be tracked by case instead of by item (diaper)?
- Rachel: asked for any updates on the initial questions on the intake form for partners, discussed making it customizable for each partner individually; it currently is for the entire instance, but it is not customizable for each partner.
