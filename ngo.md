### Type of Application

Human Essentials is an inventory management system for basic needs banks. Basic needs banks include diaper banks, period supply banks, and adult incontinence banks.

The application assumes a bank and partner organization model where the bank distributes supplies to partner organizations with those partner organizations distributing to the public. The software handles all aspects of inventory and partner management including:
* Intake through purchases, donations, and donation drives
* Partner accounts and management
* Partner requests and fulfillment
* Warehouse locations
* Inventory audits
* Scheduling partner inventory pick ups and deliveries
* And much more

### Other Uses

The software could easily be adapted for any type of donation bank. In fact, this software started with only serving diaper banks. Later, when it changed to diaper and period supply banks the majority of changes needed to accomplish that were cosmetic such as changing the name of a diaper drive to a donation drive.
