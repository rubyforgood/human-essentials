    <p>Greetings from the Diaperbase Team,</p>

    <h3> Click 'Confirm' when you want to continue requesting an account with us </h3>

    <%= link_to 'Confirm This Request', confirmation_account_requests_url(token: @account_request.identity_token) %>

    <p>
      We're delighted to hear from you and hope you're all staying well!
    </p>

    <p>
      First, and most importantly, DiaperBase is 100% free! We're supported by the non-profit Code for Good and Microsoft sponsors the servers!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you'd like to experience the app, please log in to the sandbox/demo sites and test it out.
      Here is the login information for the demo sites:
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href='https://diaperbase.org/'>DiaperBase</a>
      <br>
      <span>Username: org_admin1@example.com</span>
      <br>
      <span>Password: password</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href='https://partnerbase.org/'>PartnerBase</a>
      <br>
      <span>Username: verified@example.com</span>
      <br>
      <span>Password: password</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      A couple things to know about the sandbox servers before you start using them:
      The development team uses the servers for testing our new features and upgrades before putting them on the live site to ensure that no bugs get pushed through to the live site, so if something looks different than the (real) diaper.app site that is probably why! Please donâ€™t enter any sensitive information into the demo servers, several users have access to the demo servers and it will be visible to all users.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, we made a getting started video with detailed directions on setting up your diaper bank in DiaperBase, check it out
    <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwo3WKMGM_4&feature=youtu.be'>here</a>! Please let us know when you would like to begin using DiaperBase and we will set you up and send you a welcome email.
    </p>
