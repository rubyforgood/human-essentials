### Welcome!

We are excited you are interested in doing some good with us and contributing to our project!

Regardless if you contribute as a team or as an individual we ask that you follow our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

### Contributing as an Individual

Any issue that has the label [Help Wanted](https://github.com/rubyforgood/human-essentials/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22) is available to be worked on. Just claim the issue by leaving a comment on it. This way the the team will know you are going to be working on it and it will be assigned to you!

### Contributing as a Team

We welcome contributions from teams and have had great success facilitating teams contributing to our project in the past. We have two different approaches for teams who are interested in contributing. 

#### Approach One - Work is queued up for you

This is where we have defined a larger chunk of work that needs to be done, the work is fully understood, it is ready to start immediately, and we just need some people to complete it.

An example of this is the theme upgrade and facelift we have planned for the project. We have created a [massive issue](https://github.com/rubyforgood/human-essentials/issues/2965) that lists all the user facing pages and files (337 of them!) that need to first be evaluated for compatibility with the new theme, and then upgraded once they are evaluted!

#### Approach Two - You discover the work and suggest how to accomplish it

This approach is where we know there is work to be done but we haven't done the research or discovery with the stakeholders yet to determine how to best implement it.

With this approach you will have to opportunity to meet, interact, and do research with the people the code you will be creating is going to be helping. You'll hear first hand their frustrations and work with us to create the best solution for them.
